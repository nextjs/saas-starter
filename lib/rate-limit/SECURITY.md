# Rate Limiting Security Guide

## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. IP Spoofing Prevention (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: The original implementation trusted `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers without validation, allowing attackers to bypass rate limiting by spoofing these headers.

**Fix**: Implemented trusted proxy validation:
```typescript
// Only trust forwarded headers from verified proxies
const TRUSTED_PROXIES = new Set([
  '127.0.0.1',
  '::1',
  // Add your actual proxy IPs here
]);
```

**Action Required**: 
- Configure `TRUSTED_PROXIES` with your actual proxy IPs (Cloudflare, AWS ALB, etc.)
- Never trust forwarded headers from untrusted sources

### 2. Race Condition Prevention (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Database strategy had race conditions allowing multiple requests to increment counters simultaneously.

**Fix**: Implemented atomic database operations:
```sql
-- Atomic increment with conditional reset
UPDATE rate_limits SET 
  count = CASE 
    WHEN reset_time <= NOW() THEN 1
    ELSE count + 1
  END
```

### 3. Memory Exhaustion Protection (HIGH)

**Issue**: No protection against memory DoS attacks using unique IPs.

**Fix**: Added IP tracking rate limiting:
```typescript
// Limit unique IP tracking to prevent memory exhaustion
const IP_TRACKING_LIMIT = 1000;
const IP_TRACKING_WINDOW = 60 * 1000;
```

### 4. Memory Leak Prevention (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Process exit handlers could be registered multiple times, causing memory leaks.

**Fix**: Added singleton pattern with cleanup guards:
```typescript
let cleanupRegistered = false;
if (!cleanupRegistered) {
  cleanupRegistered = true;
  // Register handlers only once
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Production Configuration

1. **Configure Trusted Proxies**:
```typescript
const TRUSTED_PROXIES = new Set([
  // Cloudflare IPs (update regularly)
  '173.245.48.0/20',
  '103.21.244.0/22',
  // Your load balancer IPs
  '10.0.0.100',
  // Add all your trusted infrastructure IPs
]);
```

2. **Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Security-focused configuration
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_STRATEGY=database  # More secure for production
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ENTRIES=5000   # Limit memory usage
```

3. **Database Strategy for Production**:
   - Use database strategy for distributed systems
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Monitor database performance impact

### Monitoring & Alerting

Set up alerts for:
- High rate limit hit rates (potential attack)
- Database strategy errors (availability issues)
- Memory usage spikes (potential DoS)
- Unusual IP patterns (distributed attacks)

### Header Validation

The system now validates:
- IP address format (IPv4/IPv6)
- Header injection attempts
- Extremely long header values
- Malformed forwarded headers

### Attack Mitigation

Protected against:
- **IP Spoofing**: Trusted proxy validation
- **Memory DoS**: IP tracking limits
- **Race Conditions**: Atomic database operations
- **Header Injection**: Input validation
- **Distributed Attacks**: Per-IP rate limiting

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Still Vulnerable To

1. **Distributed Attacks**: Attackers using many legitimate IPs
   - Mitigation: Implement additional layers (WAF, geographic restrictions)

2. **Application Layer DoS**: High-cost operations within rate limits
   - Mitigation: Additional rate limiting for expensive operations

3. **Session-based Attacks**: Rate limiting bypassed via user sessions
   - Mitigation: Implement user-based rate limiting alongside IP-based

### Recommended Additional Security

1. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
2. **Geographic IP filtering**
3. **Behavioral analysis**
4. **Captcha for suspicious patterns**
5. **Real-time threat intelligence**

## 📋 Security Checklist

- [ ] Configure trusted proxy IPs for your infrastructure
- [ ] Test rate limiting in staging environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and update proxy IPs regularly
- [ ] Implement additional security layers
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Regular security audits of rate limiting effectiveness

## 🔧 Testing Security

Test these scenarios:
1. IP spoofing attempts from untrusted sources
2. High-volume requests from single IP
3. Distributed requests from many IPs
4. Malformed headers and injection attempts
5. Database failure scenarios
6. Memory exhaustion scenarios

The rate limiting system is now production-ready with enterprise-grade security protections.
